    1. Enable the DAC clock by setting bit 17 in CMU_HFPERCLKEN0
    2. Prescale DAC clock by writing 0x50010 to DAC0_CTRL
    3. Enable left and right audio channels by writing 1 to DAC0_CH0CTRL and DAC0_CH1CTRL
    4. Write a continuous stream of samples to the DAC data registers, DAC0_CH0DATA and DAC0_CH1DATA, for example from a timer interrupt
